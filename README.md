# osmo-tester - Macbook-Online-Store-review

**Overview Macbook Online Store:**

Automation was done using Cypress.  
One test is expected to fail because it's an actual bug (read test logs).  
All automated tests are inside `./cypress/tests/tests.spec.js.`

**To run tests:**

- checkout this branch
  inside project directory in terminal run:
- `npx cypress run` to run tests in the terminal
  or
- `npx cypress open` to run tests in Cypress UI

The expected result of the test run: 6 tests will pass and 1 (last) test will fail.

**GitHub Actions**

Stack of tests automaticly runing on GitHub Actions after each push or pull request.

**What can be done:**

- more functional and API tests can be added;
- more manual tets can be automated;
- gitHub CI;

**Tests and Bugs:**

**Note:** Given the lack of requirements, some of the tests and bugs were created based on assumptions and  
common sense.
