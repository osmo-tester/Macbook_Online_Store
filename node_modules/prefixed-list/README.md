## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 or above.

```sh
npm install --save prefixed-list
```

## Use

Pass a list of strings with common prefix to get back a shorter string

```js
const prefixedList = require('prefixed-list')
const list = ['prefix-foo', 'prefix-bar', 'prefix-baz']
const result = prefixedList(list)
// result is
// "prefix-{foo, bar, baz}"
```

If the strings do not have common prefix, a string is returned with
just the `list.join(', ')`.

If a list contains a single item, it is returned by itself.
